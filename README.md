note: work in progress work in progress work in progress work in progress work in progress work in progress. sdkserver isnt even finished!!

uses java 25. prob can be lower but i dont care, not gonna check.

sdksv could be better but ive no clue how it actually works (im deadass just translating someone else's code for the sdkserver lol and this is my first java project) and again, not gonna check. if user system and login works, it works.

commands to use:
- formatting: `mvn spotless:apply`
- compiling: `mvn compile`
- running: `mvn exec:java`
