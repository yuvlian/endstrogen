One claims that she once succumbed to severe Blight infection and was taken to a medical facility for treatment where she miraculously survived. But to keep her alive, part of her spinal cord and several organs were replaced with Originium structures. Another rumor claims she is entrusted with a mysterious Directive. Despite being the official spokesperson of Endfield Industries, Perlica has never responded to such claims.\\nShe is capable of responding to various crises in a calm and decisive manner. However, Endfield often faces challenges that go beyond their expectations. Perlica often has to move between bases and outposts, doing whatever she can to maintain order and keep things running.\\n\\n\\n\\\"We don't simply talk about our dreams.

But this has never consumed his sanity and instead gives him a maturity that goes far beyond his age.\\nWulfgard will not actively pick a fight with others. If he has doubts, he simply questions things in his own special way. Wulfgard is also skilled in stealth and recon combat operations. To complete his mission, the mercenary can even travel with his foes and deal the lethal strike when the enemies least expect it.\\nA former member of the Landbreaker clan known as the Pack, Wulfgard can be a reliable and trustworthy friend if you can earn his trust.

His latest assignment saw him being dispatched by the HAS (through Operator Chen Qianyu's recommendation) to serve as a specialist liaison at Endfield Industries.\\nAmong the long list of his employment history, Da Pan treats chef work as the crowning achievement of his professional career. He is extremely passionate about cooking and readily engages himself in the creation of new recipes, inventing fusion dishes, and identifying novel ingredients. His favorite pastime is to prepare palatable cuisine that diners might enjoy.\\nDa Pan carries a special bottle with him wherever he goes. It doesn't look like anything special to most people, but anyone familiar with the writing of Yan would wonder about its origins. However, if that person happens to be from Hongshan, they would immediately recognize its origins and significance, because they know very well that the bottle is an item of honor only awarded to \\\"major contributors to science\\\".\\n\\n\\n\\\"Need help at the canteen?

The less-than-10-year-old boy had no choice but to mature quickly.\\nHe accepted a prosthetic arm and poured effort into every step of his recovery. He endured through the pain of maturing and emerged as a capable and dependable young man. Whether serving as a Wuling City Guards reservist to help folks out, or protecting his little sister as a caring brother, the 16-year-old tackles his responsibilities with a level of thoughtfulness and attentiveness that consistently impresses—and sometimes amazes—those around him.\\nThis is why one should never dismiss Lifeng as merely a naive teenager.

But the girl's occasional display of \\\"Lateran vibes\\\" would quickly reveal her affiliation with the Cabal of Tranquility.\\nAccording to what Xaihi said about herself, people believe that her past gave her knowledge and skills that should not be wielded by someone her age. This is evident in Xaihi's elegant mastery of the Originium Arts and proficiency in various fields, especially those pertaining to information technology.\\nDespite her appearances, the way that Xaihi talks and acts is hardly typical of a girl who grew up in a cloister. One must get used to her vast and seemingly trivial knowledge as well as her tendency to jump from one strange topic to the next.

However, fortune also smiled upon her when a group of Fiannæ Circuit members found and saved her from the brink of death.\\nThe Fiannæ Circuit accepted Arclight. There, she quickly learned how to survive in a harsh landscape and follow the practice of Kerns from poems to help people out. Today, she roams the wildlands to teach more souls the way of surviving in the unforgiving world of Talos-II.\\nArclight may come across as cold and brusque at first, but the minimalist philosophy underlying her cold demeanor actually proves to be exceptionally effective for surviving in the wildlands.\\n\\n\\n\\\"And it shall be like fire ... offering warmth and illumination.\\\"\",\"cid\":\"qMIjdvqY0G8ej2zT\",\"anime\":true},{\"key\":\"laevatain\",\"code\":\"11\",\"name\":\"Laevatain\",\"codename\":\"Laevatain\",\"camp\":\"Rhodes Island\",\"race\":\"Sarkaz\",\"intro\":\"\\\"Twilight of ruin!\\\"\\nLaevatain is a Rhodes Island Operator assigned to Endfield Industries where she serves as a specialist operator following the framework agreement between the two companies.\\nWith Warfarin's authorization, Laevatain once spent years in the north to carry out a solo field mission, thanks to her strong skills in independent operations. What's even more impressive is her exceptional performance in Endfield's tests on teamwork adaptability and communication skills.\\nThis is also reflected in her peer feedback. Most Endfielders who have worked with Laevatain give her high praise. They say she might come across as a \\\"fiery girl\\\" at first, but she's actually not fiery at all. Instead, she is an excellent listener and coordinator.\\nHowever, she sometimes talks about things nobody really understands, like \\\"the threat of demons\\\".
